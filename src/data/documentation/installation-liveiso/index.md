| **Windows OS**         | [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/)                        |
| **OSX**                | [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)           |

    
Rufus provides a straight forward process for writing the iso file content to the target disk, you just need to 
select the SSD drive and the Iso source file and begin the imaging process.

### Persistent state

Additional step is needed to create a persistent state of the LiveUSB which will save changes made while using the LiveUSB.

To create the persistent state download the 
[Pendrive Casper RW Creator for Window OS](https://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Casper-RW-Creator/PDL-Casper-RW-Creator.exe).

Open the downloaded file and choose the right file size for the persistent storage and execute.

> Only use the empty space left after the iso image as the maximum file size for the storage.
